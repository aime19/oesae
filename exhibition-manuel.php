                                    <p>Exhibitors should arrange for a representative to be on their stand during the build-up
                                        period to receive goods and deliveries.</p>

                                    <p>All exhibitors will be expected to manage their branding in such a way that they fit
                                        into only their booth space, without spilling out into other exhibitor’s spaces or
                                        the aisle.</p>
                                    <p>All branding that might damage the booths (Adhesive, Pins, Nails,…) are prohibited.</p>
